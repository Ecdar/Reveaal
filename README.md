# Reveaal

## About
This is a model checking engine for ECDAR (Environment for Compositional Design and Analysis of Real Time Systems) written in rust. 

#### DBM Library
The engine uses the ECDAR DBM Library for operations on zones of time (https://www.github.com/ECDAR/EDBM).

## Prerequisites 
- A rust compiler installed (https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- A folder containing the model components to check
- Download ProtoBuf definitions with ```git submodule update --init --recursive```

### Compiling on Linux
You may need the ProtoBuf compiler protoc (for the Ubuntu linux distribution ```apt install protobuf-compiler```)

### Compiling on Windows
We recommend installing and using the default `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` Rust targets.
If you instead (not recommended) are using `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` targets on Windows you need to install mingw and add it to your PATH variable to build.

## Building the project
- Build the project using `cargo build`
- Optionally run the tests using `cargo test`

## Cross compiling from Linux
The project is pure Rust so one should be able to crosscompile to any platform with a rust target.

### Compiling to Windows from Linux
Make sure you have mingw installed `sudo apt-get install mingw-w64` and the rustc windows target is installed with `rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` and build with cargo:
`cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
