# Reveaal

## About
This is a model checking engine for ECDAR (Environment for Compositional Design and Analysis of Real Time Systems) written in rust. 

#### DBM Library
The engine uses the ECDAR DBM Library for operations on zones of time (https://www.github.com/ECDAR/EDBM).

## Building

### Prerequisites 
- A rust compiler installed (https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- A folder containing the model components to check
- Download ProtoBuf definitions with ```git submodule update --init --recursive```

**Windows**:
We recommend installing and using the default ```x86_64-pc-windows-msvc``` Rust targets.
If you instead (not recommended) are using ```x86_64-pc-windows-gnu``` targets on Windows you need to install mingw and add it to your PATH variable to build.

#### Protobuf
**Debian based (Ubuntu, mint etc.)**: ```apt install protobuf-compiler```

**Arch based (Endeavour etc.)**: ```yay protobuf-c```

**Windows**: Download protobuf (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/)
Add the bin folder to your path environment variable (https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)

### Compiling and running
- Build the project using ```cargo build```
- Optionally run the tests using ```cargo test```

#### Cross compiling
The project is pure Rust so one should be able to crosscompile to any platform with a rust target.

**Debian -> Windows**
Make sure you have mingw installed ```sudo apt-get install mingw-w64``` and the rustc windows target is installed with ```rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu``` and build with cargo:
```cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu```
